The air is thick with smoke blocking out the sky.
Rain drops carve their paths over my cheeks.
The charcoal smog bites at my throat as I gasp for breath.
But all that seems to fill my lungs is the stain of bloody rain cutting through the air.
A man walks up to me, eyeing me through his horizonless visor.
I try to find the strength to run once more.
All of the muscles and veins in my being. Begging for the shot of electricity they need to move.

HEY!!! I told you not to touch that one!

The voice rings out from the distance, saving me from my unpreventable death.
The same voice that, moments ago, gave the order to kill us all...
FLTR:64,4,0,1
My body lays limp. The smoke clouds the moonlight further.
Rain flushes the tears out of my eyes.
I wait and wait. Wait for the blood to let it all end for me.
But it wont.
FLTR:26,2,0,1
Medics have surrounded me now, frantically patching my body together at the seams.
I feel myself starting to go.
FLTR:0,0,0,1
Starting to drift away.
My eyelids get heavier and heavier with each passing moment.
I'm on a stretcher now, being carried to their vehicle.
The moon has long since lost its brilliant shine.
The distant sounds of war trail behind me.
I'm lucky to have escaped... Or so I think.
Just as my mind drifts away.
Just as...

Gah! Still radio silent over here.
How's it sound from over there?

You're a moron, you know that?
NAME:P.A.
Ouch.
Why do you have to be so mean?
All I'm trying to do is fix the P.A. system.
NAME:P.A.
And that's exactly why you're a moron, Klive.
You fixed the P.A. an hour ago. Now all you're doing is blaring the alarm every five seconds.
NOIS:buzzer
Like that.
NAME:P.A. (Klive)
Nonsense!
If I fixed the system an hour ago, the system would've told me I did.
I should know. I'm the one who designed the whole thing.
NAME:P.A. (???)
Well I'm telling you, it's fixed. Can't you trust that?
NAME:P.A. (Klive)
And why in the world should I go around trusting your word, Theia?
NAME:P.A. (Theia)
Great question Klive! Why should you go about trusting me? Why should someone as brilliant as you believe a word that comes out of an idiot like me's mouth?
Oh! You know what might help convince you?!
The fact that I've been standing in the chamber for the last half an hour listening to our conversation echo over the P.A. each time you turn it on!
Maybe that helps you.

Oh.

Yeah.

We hope you've enjoyed your extended stay in cryosleep for the last twenty years or so.

Forget that. It's not important.
PIC1:Klive_Dialogue_Smug
What is important is that you are awake right now!
And being awake right now means you get to test some stuff out for us!
Yep! You heard that right! Welcome to Portal 3! Valve couldn't count past three so we decided to start counting for them! I'm your host, the deadly robot psychopath GLaDOS, and this is soon to be your final resting place!

I'm giving up trying to do my job.

What is it Klive?
NAME:Klive
Are you sure she works?
She just fell down a whole story and didn't even try to do the whole time travelly thingy.
At least, that's what the geiger counter is telling me...
I mean I guess I'm not that familiar with the selection process and all that, but something must be off if she can't even do that, right?
NAME:P.A. (Theia)
Did you tell her how to do it?

Nope, that's step two. We're still on step one.

Welp.
Good news N-0!
You're going on your first mission!
Remember, your opponent is a rampaging genetically enhanced monster out on a plot for vengeance and you don't even have five minutes of proper combat training!
No worries! (Right?)
Anyways, when you're ready you can jump out that window over there!

Good news!
Time kinda sucks!
The devs messed up and only had enough to properly integrate a tutorial level.
So welcome to Portal 3, actually this time.
Right now, all you're gonna see is a bunch of level designs we have thrown at a wall.
Most of them play around with some puzzle ideas regarding one core mechanic or another.
Hope you enjoy.
